When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  I want to use a remote repository to share my projects to others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Because with git pull remote_name branch_name you get all the files in GitHub that you may haven't in your working directory.
